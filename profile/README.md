# Chainguard EmeritOSS

chainguard-forks is the official GitHub organization for the Chainguard
EmeritOSS project. 

EmeritOSS is our approach to provide sustainable stewardship for select mature
open source projects:
 
* Create public forks of abandoned projects
* Maintain projects with minimal updates for security issues only
* Update dependencies when possible
* Release regularly
* No feature development
* No bug fix commitments
* Issues and PRs are turned off

Benefits:

* Continued possibility to use project safely
* Extended time for legacy use
* Ability to work on migration without urgency
* Potential base for separate community forks
